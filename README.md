EagleEpidoc
===========

Sample files from Eagle projects going to Epidoc: for people with more experience to check

schema-example v.1.0 is a text file actually where we ask projects to export their databases. That is way there are comments into attributes... 

the mapping of all databases can be found here: http://goo.gl/VNxFDs

after this step files will go through stages of automatized mark up to get a basic leiden encoding, possibly using this tool

https://github.com/PietroLiuzzo/epidocupconversion

they will then be populated with values from this vocabularies (TEMATRES):

always with an XSLT which is still to be done.
